# ASI_playground

All sky images playground. Image processing, Machine learning on ASI's

## Description
This project focuses on solar forecasting. The input data (which is not public) exists out of ASI images, observed temperature, humidity, irridiance. Additionally, data from PVlib is used (which is public).

## Models
This is a regression problem solved with machine learning models:

- Random forests
- Artificial neural networks
- Long short-term memory
- Flow - CNN

## Research:

Thesis/paper will be published soon..
